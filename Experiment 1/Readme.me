Object of the experiment: 
(a). Determine the first 10 harmonics of a square wave of given frequency and amplitude
using spectrum analyser. Compare the experimental values with the theoretical values of
harmonics obtained from Fourier series.
(b). Synthesize the above square wave by summing the first 3, 5, and 10 harmonics.
